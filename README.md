# Far Better

An attempt at improving upon the "Far Colder" HPI acronym using logic and pictures. A work-in-progress.

Have an idea? Email me at karl.santiago@tufts.edu -- Thanks!

## Method

Organize HPI data collection around 3 logical themes: **Space**, **Time**, and **Relativity**.

### Space

1. **Character** - "How would you describe the pain?"
2. **Location** - "Where is the pain located?" OR "Where does it start?"
3. **Radiation** - "Where does the pain travel?"

### Time

4. **Onset** - "When did the pain start?" OR "When does it start?"
5. **Duration** - "How long does it last?"
6. **Frequency** - "How often does it happen?"

### Relativity

7. **Exacerbating Factors** - "What makes the pain worse?"
8. **Relieving Factors** - "What makes the pain better?"
9. **Associated Symptoms** - "What symptoms are related to this pain?"
