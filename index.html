              <p><strong title="Too long; didn't read">TL;DR</strong> &mdash; I made a few changes!</p>
              <hr />
              <p>Hi! First off, thanks to everyone who gave feedback on <a href="http://imbreakfast.github.io/far-better">Far Better</a>! I'm thrilled somebody (besides me) finds it useful. Based on your feedback, I've put together some changes which I've detailed below.</p>
              <p>One quick note: Far Better is now hosted on Github under an open source license. The link to the repository is <a href="http://imbreakfast.github.io/far-better">http://imbreakfast.github.io/far-better</a>.</p>
              <h3>And now, some lengthy thoughts:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Questions that were previously close-ended were converted into open-ended ones (a la the Dr. Barnewolt's excellent in-class exercise).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Shane Naki</strong> made a great comment about leading off with questions about <strong><em>time</em></strong> as opposed to <strong><em>space</em></strong>, and I agree 100%, so I've edited Far Better accordingly.</p>
                  <p>My personal issue is that I'm not the best at your maintaining a timeline of events in my head, so I save questions about time for last &ndash; that's just me. Feel free to organize the themes as you see fit. In truth, as we become more experienced and knowledgable (hopefully not too far from now), we'll probably be jumping around these topics seamlessly. For instance, your natural progression might end up looking something like:</p>
                  <blockquote>Onset / Quality / Location / Duration / Frequency / Radiation / Exacerbating factors / Associated symptoms / Relieving factors</blockquote>
                  <p>Hopefully, Far Better expedites this process for you by helping initially organize your thoughts.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>The figures were helpful to me as I was thinking through this. They're kind of silly. I realize that it's not so helpful to others, so I've moved them away from the main page and gave them their own section.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>I think you'll all recognize that this is super-low hanging fruit, but that's kind of the point. Even at an early stage of training, I don't think much stands in the way of collecting solid data in a fluid way. And the more fluid the conversation, the more comfortable patients will feel.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>2013-09-12</h2>
              <p>After reading for Week 4 of <abbr title="Medical Interviewing and the Doctor-Patient Relationship">MIDPR</abbr>, I started work on an alternative to "Far Colder" (pg 64). Why? Because I think acronyms are the worst, and I'd like to collect HPI without fumbling over one.</p>
              <p>So, I present to you "Far Better" &ndash; obviously, it's a work-in-progress, and I'll be tweaking it over the next few months. If you think it can be improved, that's because it probably can; your feedback is much appreciated. Thanks!<p>
