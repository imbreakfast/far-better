              <p><strong title="Too long; didn't read">TL;DR</strong> &mdash; I made a few changes!</p>
              <hr />
              <p>Hi! Thanks to everyone who gave feedback on <a href="http://imbreakfast.github.io/far-better">Far Better</a>! I'm thrilled folks found it somewhat useful. Based on your feedback, I've put together some changes which I've detailed below.</p>
              <p>(One quick note: Far Better is now hosted on Github under an open source license; the link to the repository is <a href="https://github.com/imbreakfast/far-better">https://github.com/imbreakfast/far-better</a>.)</p>
              <h3>And now, lengthy thoughts ...</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p><span class="highlighted"><strong>Shane Naki</strong> made a great comment about following questions about <strong>Space</strong> with those to do with <strong>Time</strong> (as opposed to Relation), and I agree 100%, so I've edited Far Better accordingly. Shane also suggests starting with <strong>Location</strong>, followed by <strong>Character</strong> and <strong>Radiation</strong>.</span></p>
                  <p>With regards to Time, my personal issue is that I'm not the best at maintaining a timeline of events in my head, so I've been saving those questions for last &ndash; that's just me.</p>
                  <p>That said, feel free to organize the themes as you see fit. In truth, as we become more experienced and knowledgable (hopefully not too far from now), we'll probably be jumping around these questions seamlessly. For instance, your natural progression might end up looking something like:</p>
                  <blockquote>Onset / Quality / Location / Duration / Frequency / Radiation / Exacerbating factors / Associated symptoms / Relieving factors</blockquote>
                  <p>Hopefully, Far Better expedites this process for you by helping to initially organize your thoughts.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Sample questions that were previously close-ended were turned into <strong>open-ended questions</strong> (a la Dr. Barnewolt's excellent in-class exercise).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>The figures and analogies were helpful to me as I was thinking through this. They're kind of silly. I realize that they're not so helpful to others, so I've moved them away from the main page and gave them their own section (see Figures).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>I think you'll all recognize that this is <strong>super</strong> low hanging fruit, but that's kind of the point. Even at an early stage of training, I don't think much stands in the way of collecting solid data in a fluid way. And the more fluid the conversation, the more comfortable patients will feel.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>2013-09-12</h2>
              <p>After reading for Week 4 of <abbr title="Medical Interviewing and the Doctor-Patient Relationship">MIDPR</abbr>, I started work on an alternative to "Far Colder" (pg 64). Why? Because I think acronyms are the worst, and I'd like to collect HPI without fumbling over one.</p>
              <p>So, I present to you "Far Better" &ndash; obviously, it's a work-in-progress, and I'll be tweaking it over the next few months. If you think it can be improved, that's because it probably can; your feedback is much appreciated. Thanks!<p>
